# Sleep Health and Lifestyle Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing a dataset related to sleep, health, and lifestyle. The script covers a wide range of data exploration and visualization tasks, including data cleaning, correlation analysis, and the creation of various visualizations to better understand the dataset's contents.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** The script handles missing values and standardizes certain categories in the dataset for consistency, ensuring that the data is in a clean and usable format.

- **Visualization:** The repository provides an array of visualizations to represent and communicate the data effectively. These include pie charts showcasing the distribution of BMI categories and sleep disorders, bar charts comparing sleep duration and stress levels by gender, and bar charts illustrating stress levels by occupation and gender.

- **Relationship Analysis:** The script delves into the relationships between different features within the dataset. It explores the connections between daily steps and BMI categories, quality of sleep by occupation, blood pressure values by age and occupation, and heart rate trends by physical activity level.

- **Correlation Analysis:** A correlation matrix is generated, offering insights into the relationships between various numerical features such as age, sleep duration, quality of sleep, physical activity level, stress level, heart rate, Mean Blood Pressure (MBP), and daily steps. This is visually represented through a heatmap.
